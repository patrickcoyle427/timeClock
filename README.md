# timeClock

Asks for the users name, then records their clock-in time.
The next time that name is typed, that person will be clocked-out.
This information is saved as a JSON file that is imported/exported when
the program is closed.

# To Do

* Allow employees to clock in with a PIN instead of their name.
* Add an Admin Panel
  * Admin panel should be password protected
    * Learn more about encryption
  * Allows the admin to create employees and login PINs
  * Employer can 0 out the employee's hours worked and export the info
    * Maybe set this up to do automatically each week?
* Add logging of who clocked in/out and when
* Eventually add a GUI
